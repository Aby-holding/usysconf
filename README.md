Universal system configuration interface for operating systems (i.e. Solus)

This is a staging tree to work on a new component for Solus, a configuration interface
that centralises all of the stateful configuration tasks currently handled in many disconnected
package install scripts.

This project will provide a unified approach to configuring the system, and is designed
to be the very last operation that package manager would call in a stack. This also allows
Solus to drop the [COMAR system](https://solus-project.com/2017/11/12/this-week-in-solus-install-48/).

In time this will also expand to incorporate management of stateless configuration
policies. For now we are focused on providing the automated system configuration
components to provide a fail-safe binary that is immune to update issues and can
safely apply system changes (such as cache and system user management).

We will also provide a CLI interface to allow usysconf to be utilised as a recovery
tool, enabling users to apply triggers and bring their system back up to full health.

`usysconf` is a [Solus project](https://solus-project.com/)
